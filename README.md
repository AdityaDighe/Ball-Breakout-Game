# Over-view

Implementation of a ball breakout game using Java graphic user interfaces with the concepts of multiple classes, inheritance and event listeners in Java. The project focuses on developing the game taking into consideration the graphical concepts and storing the high score of the user.
 
# User Interface & Explanation

A yellow boundary is drawn along the edges of the window to indicate the wall. Once a ball touches or hits the edge it rebounds along the other direction following the rules of physics. The white boxes present in the image are the elements that are eliminated once the ball hits these. There is a High Score count that keeps the track of the highest score achieved so far.

Representation of boxes getting removed on hitting them. Use of event listeners like left and right arrow key to move the wedge left or right as per the users decision.

On pressing the Enter button the game restarts itself by listening to the event.

The future scope for this project remains to store the high score in csv files and fecth it to be updated accordingly.
